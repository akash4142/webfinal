        <h2>Experience</h2>
<p>I recently had the opportunity to develop a website for a thrilling online game called SnakeMania. As a web developer with expertise in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and back-end technologies, I was excited to take on the challenge of creating an engaging and interactive gaming website.

    The project involved creating a user-friendly interface that would provide players with an immersive gaming experience. I designed and implemented the website using modern web technologies, ensuring a visually appealing layout and smooth navigation. The website was designed to be responsive, ensuring that it works seamlessly across different devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones.
    
    One of the highlights of the website was the gameplay itself. I implemented the SnakeMania game using JavaScript, creating a dynamic and interactive game environment. The game featured a classic Snake gameplay, where players controlled a snake to eat food and grow in size, while avoiding collisions with walls and themselves. I added various features, such as different levels of difficulty, high scores, and a game over screen with options to restart or share scores on social media.
    
    To enhance the overall user experience, I integrated sound effects, animations, and visual cues to provide feedback on game progress and actions. I also implemented smooth transitions and animations to create a polished and professional look and feel.
    
    In addition to the front-end development, I also integrated back-end technologies such as databases and server-side logic to handle game state management, player authentication, and high score tracking. I used SQL to manage the database, storing game scores and player information securely.
    
    Throughout the development process, I conducted thorough testing to identify and fix any bugs or issues. I also incorporated feedback from playtesters to improve the game mechanics and overall performance.
    
    Overall, building the SnakeMania game website was an exciting and challenging project. It allowed me to showcase my skills in web development and create an engaging and interactive gaming experience for players. I am proud of the final result and look forward to sharing it with gaming enthusiasts around the world.</p>
